# PolyScape Creator

PolyScape Creator is a 3D world-building game developed using the Godot game engine. It allows users to create custom low-poly environments using a tile-based system.

- Within the tile building screen, players can adjust various properties of the tiles, including dynamic rotation for added realism. This feature enables the creation of complex structures such as stairs and slopes that seamlessly integrate into the landscape.
- The game features a day phase slider to manipulate the atmosphere, transitioning from day to night with changing sky colors. This adds depth and immersion to the virtual environments.
- Navigation controls are intuitive, allowing players to move the camera using the WASD keys, zoom in and out, and rotate the view with the middle mouse button.
- Tile placement is facilitated by ray-casting, ensuring precise positioning during construction. When users left-click and drag the mouse, a selection is formed for the upcoming placement of tiles once the left click is released. Conversely, right-clicking and dragging the mouse will reveal an advanced options menu for the created selection, providing players with choices to delete or insert tiles.
